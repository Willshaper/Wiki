FTB Revelation
==============

Concept
-------
Revelation is a general all-purpose modpack with optimal FPS, server performance and stability.  This is the largest pack ever built to date, by the Feed The Beast Team.  Ongoing development, support and updates insure you will have the best experience as a player whether your a seasoned player or new to modded Minecraft.

 

Revelation is not a themed pack nor a focused pack, it’s a pack designed to cater to a large amount of players, whether you like tech mods, magic mods, exploration, building or all of those then this pack is for you.  With a Forge Mod Loader count of well over 200, this pack has most everything a player is looking for with performance and stability being the main focus of design and mod choice.  Minimal changes have been made to the mods so you experience each mod the way the developers intended.  Also this proves very helpful when learning a new mod using a Wiki.

 

Large well-known mods such as EnderIO, Applied Energistics, Thaumcraft, Botania, Thermal Expansion, Immersive Engineering and Project Red are present in Revelation, as well as some lesser known mods like Rustic, Gadgetry,  Thut’s Elevators and xnet.  Twilight Forest also makes a comeback in Revelation v2.0.0+ for all the exploration players.

 

Whether you want to build in a cave and reach the end of progression in a week, or build complex bases loaded with tech and magic infrastructure all while armoring up to take on the bosses in Twilight Forest, then Revelation is the perfect modpack for you.
