MC Eternal
==========

Concept
-------
I've spent the last 8 months and counting, handcrafting a fun and fresh new modded experience. There is plenty to discover in all aspects of Eternal and there are plenty of unique twists to keep you engaged. MCE uses basic crafting recipes. I realized blending the fun parts from the likes of modded skyblock (quests, shop, etc along with RPG elements) in a kitchen sink pack that's not too complicated turns out is super enjoyable for all types of players (especially with friends! :D) Get rewarded for doing whatever you feel like doing with the expansive optional questing system!

There is a huge emphasis on using not so known mods that I deemed to be severely underrated, especially in the Adventuring aspect of the pack.
