All of the Mods 6
=================

Concept
-------
* All the Mods started out as a private pack for just a few friends of mine that turned into something others wanted to play! It has all the basics that most other "big name" packs include but with a nice mix of some of newer or lesser-known mods as well.
* In All the Mods 6 we will continue the tradition adding many new mods while going for more stability.
* Does "All The Mods" really contain ALL THE MODS? No, of course not.

Server Adjustments
------------------
* Automatic Farmworld Resets only happen for the End which is Weekly
* By Default you have a maximum of 8 home points you can set
* ``/rtp`` has a cooldown of 15 seconds
