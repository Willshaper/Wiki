++++++

Tokens are MYM's primary in-game currency, used to obtain claimblocks, mym's, and chunk loader tickets.

Voting
------
Tokens are obtained by voting for MYM  `here <https://mineyourmind.net/vote.html>`_. 

You can only vote once per website per day, and each vote is 10 tokens. Please report any broken links via 
`Discord  <https://discord.gg/x7maj2Rk>`_, 
an `in game ticket <http://wiki.mym.li/en/latest/FAQ/general.html#create-ticket>`_, 
or a `forums <https://mineyourmind.net/forum/categories/support-forums.155/>`_ post. 

`Top voters <http://wiki.mym.li/en/latest/FAQ/general.html#what-are-vote-rewards>`_  are rewarded weekly or monthly - use ``/vote stats`` to see your progress.

How many tokens do I have?
--------------------------
Type ``/vote show`` to in-game, and a message will show up in chat letting you know how many tokens you have. Additionally, there is a scrolling message in chat that tells the same.
         
Tokens are not showing up!
--------------------------

Run ``/vote forceupdate`` and your token count should update. 
If the token count does not update after thirty minutes, please let staff know via 
`Discord  <https://discord.gg/x7maj2Rk>`_, 
an in-game ticket, 
or the `Forums <https://mineyourmind.net/forum/categories/support-forums.155/>`_.
